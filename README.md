# ChainsuranceZero

the erc20 token ChainsuranceZero CINSV0 was deployed on the etherum network today using remix.  I didnt write the code, I just made the changes suggested in the tutorial.  I guess I should figure out how to upload the code here for documentation purposes.  It's not great code.  It was not a great tutorial.  I even screwed up and threw away half an eth that I might not be able to recover.  But I'm happy because I now have my own token that I can distribute and tell the world about...

Here are the particulars from etherscan.io so you people who check these things will know it's for real.

Since I am not the author I don't know how I should go about attaching some sort of license to this thing.

I am happy to give credit to the person who wrote the tutorial.  Thats @maxnachamkin

Tutorial is here:  https://steemit.com/ethereum/@maxnachamkin/how-to-create-your-own-ethereum-token-in-an-hour-erc20-verified

He did not write the code... He gives credit to https://github.com/ConsenSys/Token-Factory Ah they are here. What a small world!

I wonder if they wrote it or copied it from somewhere else...
